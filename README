This program provides a dropdown-centric GUI for binding user movements to keyboard and mouseclick events that affect the active window.

In the first iteration of this application, the code necessary to drive the Kinect is generated through the GUI. Using this code, the user is to create a new WPF using Visual Studio C# Express, add the neccessary references, then copy and paste this code to the main form in their created application.

When the application utilizes the generated Kinect code inside itself, the application will reach version 0.1.0 status.
